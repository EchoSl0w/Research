An authenticated arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the /api/documentCache/upoad endpoint in InfoDom Performa 365 v4.0.1 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via uploading a crafted SVG file.

PoC:
- We login as user who has sufficient privileges and upload a crafted SVG file. The upload endpoint is `<host>/api/documentCache/upload`
- The PoC SVG file contains the following code:
```
<svg xmlns=[http://www.w3.org/2000/svg](http://www.w3.org/2000/svg) viewBox="0 0 500 500">
    <script>//<![CDATA[
        alert('XSS')
    //]]>
    </script>
</svg>
```
- Once uploaded, the image is set as the background of the platform.
- Inspecting the image triggers the XSS payload.
